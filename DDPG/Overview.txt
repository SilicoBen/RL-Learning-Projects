-Deterministic policies choose an action with certainty rather than stocastic policies which sample from a policy space 
-Deep deterministic models work by combining actor-critic methods with deepQ learning 

Classes:
1. A class to encourage exploration - introduces noise
    - Deterministic policies wont explore inherently which is why we need this
2. A class to handle the replay memory - DeepQ replay buffer
