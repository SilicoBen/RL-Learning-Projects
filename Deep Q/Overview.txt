DeepQ learning is a model free, bootstrapped, off policy learning method

Model Free: don't need to know anything about the dynamics of the 
environment we're going to learn action-reward pairs (not state information)

Bootstrapped: We construct estimates of action-value functions based on ealier estimates
we use one estimate to update another

Off Policy: We have a policy that generates actions = epsilon greedy - we use this
policy for updating 

Notes:

this code is a simple representation of a DeepQ learning agent not the full 
-Full DeepQ agents have both replay and target network
--this model only has a replay network because our use case (lunar-lander)
--does not require a target network. 
--replay network is always required for DeepQ - very unstable otherwise

DeepQ does not work for continuous action spaces
